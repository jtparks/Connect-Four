## The Correct Team
ft. Justin Parks, Alison Jones, Arnav Bhutani, and Justin Campbell


### Brainstorming:

    Something that uses back-end data storage

    Something that any user can use

##### Hangman?

	Page that contains title
		Subpage that takes user-generated words and adds to a database, 
		uses a random one later upon initialization
		


##### Arcade game(s)?
		
    High Scores saved on the back end
    Able to implement a number of games (or backup games)

	create all but the game itself - make a div that has a graphic, but thats it
	

##### Checkers?

	Able to use CSS shapes for the pieces, so it's easier to implement
	Relatively simple rules
	Back end data store could be numbers of wins for a user?


### Connect Four!
	
	Click and drop rules for pieces
	CSS for the "game board"
	Names of who is playing could be stored
